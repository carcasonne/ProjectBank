# ProjectBank

## Invites

Rasmys Lystr√∏m and Paulo Tell have been added to the Azure Directory and should have recieved an e-mail on the 21-12/2021 with an invite. 

## How to Run Program

You need a GUID password. You must generate your own however you like, and insert it in place of {password}

To run the program you must first have a docker container with a MySql database running:

```
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD={password}" -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

Then add the connection string to the project. Do this in the /Server directory:

```
cd .\Server\
```
```
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:ProjectBank" "Server=localhost;Database=ProjectBank;User Id=sa;Password={password}"
```

Once this is done you can run the program with:

```
dotnet run 
```

## Tips

### Loading...
If the program is stuck loading projects after your initial login, try to log out and in again. 


### Invite Supervisor
If you want to test the feature, here is a list of supervisor mails likely to be in your seeding of the system:
- martinpedersen@itu.dk
- annajensen@ku.dk
- olenielsen@ku.dk

You can manually check the database for user-mails with Azure Data Studio if so pleased
